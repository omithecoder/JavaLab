Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java API that allows programmers to access and interact with databases. It provides methods for connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and retrieving and updating data. JDBC is commonly used in Java applications to interact with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

Steps to connect to a database using JDBC:

1. Load the JDBC driver: The first step in using JDBC is to load the appropriate JDBC driver for the database you want to connect to. This can be done using the `Class.forName()` method, passing in the fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver.

2. Establish a connection to the database: Once the driver is loaded, you can establish a connection to the database using the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method, passing in the URL of the database, the username, and the password.

3. Create a statement: After establishing a connection, you can create a `Statement` object using the `createStatement()` method on the `Connection` object. This `Statement` object is used to execute SQL queries against the database.

4. Execute SQL queries: You can execute SQL queries using the `executeQuery()` method on the `Statement` object to retrieve data from the database, or the `executeUpdate()` method to update data in the database.

5. Process the results: If you executed a query that returns results, you can process the results using the `ResultSet` object returned by the `executeQuery()` method. You can iterate over the `ResultSet` to retrieve the data returned by the query.

6. Close the connection: Finally, you should close the connection to the database using the `close()` method on the `Connection` object.
